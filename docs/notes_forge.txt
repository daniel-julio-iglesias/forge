Python API script

Exercise task:

Pick an API from https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis/blob/master/README.md that:
requires authentication (apiKey or OAuth)
responds with JSON or XML
supports GET or POST request type.
    (i.e.: forge FOREX API https://1forge.com/forex-data-api/api-documentation - qoutes endpoint)

Create python script that retrieves data from one of API endpoints. The script should be called
 like:
 $ python script_name.py arg1 arg2 kwarg1=value1
 (arguments are just an example).

Script requirements:
Python 2.7
allows user to write results to specific file .csv
provides support for arguments and keyworded arguments

Other instruction:
Object-oriented approach will be appreciated
Error checks will be appreciated (incorrect arguments provided, invalid output file format,
error response from server, incorrect response etc.)
Basically show whatever you want

Example:

Script would be called like:

$ python forge_api_script.py output.csv pairs=EURUSD --debug , where:

output.csv - output filename
pairs=EURUSD â€“ currency pair to be returned by API
--debug turns debug mode of the script i.e.: more detailed log messages
Running above command would result in sending request to the following
endpoint https://forex.1forge.com/1.0.3/quotes?pairs=EURUSD with pairs=EURUSD as query argument
and saving output data to output.csv file.
